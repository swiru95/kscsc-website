            The KISS principle is a design heuristic that advises designers and developers<br>
            to strive for simplicity in their work. It suggests that simplicity leads to increased<br> 
            usability and understandability, as well as reduced complexity and cost.<br> 
            The principle encourages designers to eliminate unnecessary elements<br> 
            and focus on the essential features and functionality of a product or system.<br>
            By adhering to the KISS principle, designers and developers can create solutions<br>
            that are easy to use, maintain, and understand, leading to increased efficiency and effectiveness<br>
            and by that security.<br> <br>
